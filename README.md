# MERN E-commerce Website with Braintree Payments & Chat Feature

## Overview

This is a full-stack e-commerce application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) with Braintree payment integration and a chat feature powered by a Python-based server. The project combines MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases to handle different parts of the application, leveraging the strength of each technology for optimal performance and scalability.

### Features

- **E-commerce Functionalities**:  
  Users can browse products, add items to the cart, and complete purchases.
  
- **Braintree Payment Gateway**:  
  The project integrates Braintree's Drop-in UI for secure credit card and payment method handling.

- **Real-time Chat**:  
  A separate server built using Python FastAPI handles real-time chat communication between users and the admin.  
  - Admins can chat with all users.
  - Users can chat with the admin.
  - WebSockets are used for real-time updates.

- **Database**:  
  - **MongoDB**: Used to manage product, user, and order data.
  - **PostgreSQL**: Used by the chat system for handling real-time communication between users.
